Rules:
   	
   	Multiple cell types are allowed.
   	Any live cell has a maximum number of neigbours of any type it can tolerate.
   	If this number is exceeded - it dies.
   	Any live cell has a list of minimum and maximum neighbours of a given type to survive.
   	If at least on of these conditions is not met - it dies.
   	Any dead cell has a list of the number of neighbours of a given type to become alive again.
   	If more than one condition is met the newly born cell's type is chosen randomly.
   	If the condition is met but the maximum number of neigbours for that type is exceeded - the cell cannot be born.
